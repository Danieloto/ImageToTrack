# ImageToTrack
Script for ISU Senior Design (CprE 492)

Converts a given image into a cartesian coordinate track for the Sisyphus table:
https://sisyphus-industries.com/


Call the script like so:
python .\ImageToTrack.py .\YOUR_IMAGE_HERE.png

The filetype does not need to be png


This will output a text file with a cartesian coordinate on each line, as well as the resulting track as a sample image.
